Download it from here (Right click, Save as), make executable, and drop it in your path. Note that many browsers will rename the file rabbitmqadmin.txt. You will need Python 2.6 or later. To use rabbitmqadmin with HTTPS, Python 2.6.7 is the minimum supported version.

See the rabbitmqadmin page on the website for more information on its use, or invoke rabbitmqadmin --help for usage instructions. Windows users will need to ensure Python is on their path, and invoke rabbitmqadmin as python.exe rabbitmqadmin.
